# practica_1

For this practice, we have created a virtual store of books, which has a main menu that asks the user

for the actions that you want to develop.

the different classes that we can access are:


-1 - book

-2 - UserProduct

-3 - dates

-4 - product


The main menu have developed with a switch that calls different functions, these functions have developmented of each option from 

our menu:


-1 - introduction of personal data.

-2 - search books.

-3 - change euros to dollars and vice versa.

-4 - buy books.

-5 - exit.


The program is based on the search and find the books you want.

As for performance, I have two classes which inherit each other (book and product).

From the main menu functions, as search, we get by screen data of other kinds like names, prices etc.

In all of the classes I have used constructors and setters methods and getters for subsequent use in the main main.
